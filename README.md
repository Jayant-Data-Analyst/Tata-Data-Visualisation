# I have created the visuals around four of the questions as requested
Question 1
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

# Data Analysis  
Data Preparation: "Before conducting the analysis, I took the necessary steps to ensure the dataset was clean and reliable. This involved addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and standardizing date formats. Additionally, I carefully filtered the data to focus on the required metrics, ensuring that any inconsistencies or outliers did not distort our findings."

Question 1: Monthly Revenue Trends for 2011 (CEO’s Request)
Analysis & Insights: "I extracted revenue data for 2011 and aggregated it on a monthly basis to identify seasonal patterns." "The time series visualization highlights notable trends, with revenue peaking in [March, May, August, September, October and November] and declining in [February, April, June July and December]." "Several factors contribute to these trends, including seasonal demand fluctuations, holiday periods, and the impact of promotional campaigns." "This analysis provides a solid foundation for forecasting revenue trends in 2012 and enables informed decision-making in inventory management and marketing strategies."

Recommendation: "To enhance revenue performance, I recommend implementing strategic promotional efforts during low-performing months and optimizing inventory allocation based on seasonal demand trends."

Question 2: Top 10 Revenue-Generating Countries (CMO’s Request)
Analysis & Insights: "I identified the top 10 countries by revenue, excluding the United Kingdom as per your request." "The visualization effectively presents both revenue and quantity sold for each country, highlighting key markets." "Countries such as [Netherlands, Ireland] emerged as leading revenue contributors, indicating strong opportunities for further business expansion." "While higher revenue often aligns with higher sales volume, certain countries demonstrate strong revenue performance despite lower sales volume, which may be attributed to premium pricing strategies."

Recommendation: "I recommend strengthening marketing and logistics efforts in high-performing countries while also evaluating the potential for deeper market penetration in emerging regions."

Question 4: Global Demand Analysis by Country (CEO’s Request)
Analysis & Insights: "I analyzed product demand across all countries, excluding the United Kingdom, to identify regions with the highest demand." "The visualization presents a clear, single-view representation of demand distribution, allowing for immediate identification of high-potential regions." "Countries such as [Germany, France, Ireland] exhibit strong demand potential, making them attractive candidates for expansion efforts."

Recommendation: "Based on this analysis, I recommend initiating strategic expansion plans in high-demand regions. This should be supported by optimizing supply chain operations and tailoring marketing strategies to align with the preferences of these new markets."
